# ecg_kalman_filter
Adaptive Kalman filter–based FIR framework for ECG lead reconstruction from reduced lead sets. The method models time-varying inter-lead relationships, analyzes innovation consistency and Kalman gain dynamics, and evaluates reconstruction quality using SNR on the PTB-XL dataset.
